  \begin{abstract}
    \noindent \textbf{Background} \\
    \noindent In 2016, UNAIDS developed a Fast-Track strategy that targeted 90\% coverage
    male circumcision (MC) among men aged 10-29 years by 2021 in priority countries in sub-Saharan 
    Africa (SSA) to reduce HIV incidence. There is substantial variation across subnational 
    regions within countries in both traditional male circumcision (TMC) practices and progress
    towards implementation of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). Tracking progress and
    remaining gaps towards VMMC HIV prevention targets requires detailed district-level circumcision
    coverage data.

    \noindent \textbf{Methods} \\
    \noindent We analysed self-reported data on male circumcision from x nationally representative household
    surveys conducted in x SSA countries between 2006-2020. A spatio-temporal Bayesian
    competing-risks time-to-event model was used to estimate rates of traditional and medical
    circumcision by age, location, and time. Circumcision coverage in 2020 was projected assuming
    continuation of estimated age-specific rates, with probabilistic uncertainty.

    \noindent \textbf{Results} \\
    \noindent Across x countries, from 2010 to 2020 an estimated x million men (x\% CI x-x million)
    were newly circumcised, of whom x million (x - x million) were medically circumcised, and
    x million (x - x million) traditionally circumcised. In 2020, MC coverage among men 10-29
    years ranged from x\% (x\% - x\%) in Zimbabwe (?) to x\% (x\%-x\%) in Togo. MMC coverage
    ranged from x\% (x\%-x\%) in Malawi to x\% (x\%-x\%) in Tanzania, and TMC coverage
    from x\% (x\%-x\%) in Eswatini to x\% (x\%-x\%) in Ethiopia. The largest increase in MMC
    coverage was in Lesotho from x\% to x\%. Within countries, the median difference in MC
    coverage between the districts with lowest and highest coverage was x\%, with the smallest
    variation in Eswatini (x\% to x\%) and largest in Zambia (x\% to x\%). x million men aged
    10-29 need to be circumcised to reach 90\% coverage in all countries.

    \noindent \textbf{Conclusions} \\
    \noindent VMMC programmes have made substantial, but uneven, progress towards male circumcision targets. Granular district and age-stratified data provide information for focusing further programme implementation.

*** Research Questions

There were several key research questions which we hoped to answer with this analysis:

1. How has total, medical and traditional circumcision coverage varied across the SSA region?
   How has this changed over time? 

Result: Broadly speaking, WCA has much higher circumcision coverage, in line with greater cultural practice of TMC associated with these countries, while in ESA TMC and MC coverage is much lower, although this varies quite a lot, both nationally and sub-nationally, and has seen significant increases as a result of VMMC programme implementation in many of these countries.

The horizontal grey dashed line indicates the 90% circumcision coverage by 2021 target established by the UNAIDS Fast Track strategy. The lighter shaded area represents projection after the most recent household survey. Purple areas represent countries where circumcision type could not be ascertained from surveys.

2. How have patterns in circumcision coverage vary across different ages and age groups? 

Result: A circumcised individual is much more likely to have undergone MMC for progressively younger ages, while the converse is true for TMC. (I wonder why this isn't untrue for paediatric TMCs in VMMC countries? Surely TMCs should be higher than MMCs for these ages, at least in VMMC countries?)

The horizontal grey dashed line indicates the 90% circumcision coverage by 2021 target established by the UNAIDS Fast Track strategy. Purple areas represent countries where circumcision type could not be ascertained from surveys.

3. How does total, medical and traditional circumcision coverage vary subnationally across the SSA region? 

Result: There was significant subnational variability in circumcision coverage and type across
the SSA region, with ESA in general having more variable district level circumcision and type,
while WCA countries exhibited more homogeneous circumcision patterns. In ESA, this variability
may be in part attributed to efforts to focus VMMC programmes on areas of high disease burden and
a lack of historical TMC practice.

Each point is a district, sized by district population relative to average district size and coloured by the African region their country falls under (Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) and Western and Central Africa (WCA), respectively). Each white dot represents the national median. A vertical dotted line signifies the UNAIDS target of 90% national MC.

4. Has TMC decreased, both in response to VMMC programme implementation in target countries, and more generally across the entire SSA region? 

TMC has decreased in VMMC target countries, presumably largely due to the implementation of VMMC programs in districts which traditionally practised TMC. It has also, interestingly, declined (with a lot of variability) in non-VMMC countries, possibly in response to general economic upliftment and development in these countries. 

Plot for this? Can just refer to previous figures perhaps? Or perhaps a table is best?
Jeff: Need some sort of rates plot for this! Sounds like a good idea

5. How have efforts to meet UNAIDS goals in VMMC target countries progressed? If these targets have not been met, how many additional circumcisions are required to meet these goals? 

Result: Kenya (and maybe Mozambique?) is the only country expected to have reached the VMMC target of 90% circumcision coverage amongst 10-29 year olds by 2020. In other VMMC countries, significant progress towards this goal has been made, but there still remain a significant number of un-circumised 10-29 year olds. 

Figure: Geofaceted plot showing circumcision coverage increase over time (could do for several of the larger age groups with their associated targets as dashed lines)
However, probably only interested in VMMC countries here, so table probably more appropriate
Additional Figure: Some kind of table showing progress towards goals?

6. How do our results compare to those of the DMPPT2 model? 

Result: In many VMMC countries, threemc results and DMPPT2 results largely agree. However, for several countries, such as Tanzania, Zimbabwe and parts of Kenya, we can see that DMPPT2 estimates far exceed empirical survey and threemc estimates, and indeed the population of many districts, suggesting that they may be adversely affected by (i) people travelling from their home districts to others to avail of VMMC programmes, and (ii) possible misreporting occurring in programmatic data due to incentives to report higher numbers of circumcisions for VMMC clinics.

#+RESULTS: survey_inlines

Several major survey series include questions on male circumcision status, namely the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), AIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS) Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and, in the case of South Africa, Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) surveys.
Any surveys including a question on MC status were included. 

These surveys provided individual-level data on self-reported circumcision status by male respondents, and from this we estimated circumcision rates over time and by type for the years proceeding each survey. The following questions were of interest:
- The circumcision status of the male individual,
- The circumcision provider: whether the individual was circumcised by a health worker/professional, traditional practioner, other or unknown,
- The circumcision location: whether the individual was circumcised at a health facility, in the home of a health worker/professional, at home, at a ritual site, other or unknown
- The circumcision year, and
- The date of birth and age at response and circumcision.

The age of respondents was calculated from the century-month-code (CMC) of birth and interview dates.
PHIA surveys do not include a question for circumcision location. Circumcisions performed by a medical professional and/or in a medical setting are categorised as MMC. Otherwise, circumcisions are TMC. Where no data is present on location or provider, circumcision type is treated as "Missing".

Unfortunately, no information on age at circumcision was present in the 2004 and 2008 Botswana
Aids Impact Surveys. This complete left censoring of circumcised individuals meant that we were
unable to fit our model there.

*** Model

"threemc" (Matt's model for male circumcision) (or "Multi-level model for male circumcision"?) is
a Bayesian, spatio-temporal, competing-risks, time-to-event model (reference). We have extended
this model from its initial application in South Africa to
src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$n_iso3}
countries within the SSA region. The model produces estimates of circumcision rates, incidence and coverage (i.e. cumulative indidence), with associated uncertainty bounds, stratified by type, year, age and location. Circumcision rates are projected after their most recent household survey
assuming continuation of estimated age-specific rates, with probabilistic uncertainty. Estimates
for single ages were binned into 5-year age groups from 0-4 to 54-59, and other age groups of interest, such as 15-29 year-olds.

A key assumption of the original threemc model was that TMC was constant over time, due to the perceived intransigence in TMC practises and traditional male initiation ceremonies to tribal and other cultural or religious groups that have developed over time. MMCs amongst the paediatric (defined as those under 10) were also assumed to be constant over time, as VMMC programmes, the  main force behind the adoption of MMC in much of SSA, do not targets males below 10 (reference).

Countries were modelled at their respective PSNU area level, or the most granular level available in surveys. Model estimates were weighted by population and post-stratified to produce estimates
for their "parent" regions. 

Some additional features were added to the threemc model during the course of this analysis: 
- Where no information on circumcision type was available for every survey in a given country, a type-agnostic version of the model was used,
- Survey estimates for less granular areas were used to inform likelihood estimation for their
  "child" areas, where previously they were ignored,
- optional addition of a temporal effect for TMC, due to the suggestion of survey estimates that
  TMC practices may be changing, even in non-VMMC target countries, over time, and
- an optional random walk (RW) temporal prior was implemented, where previously only an auto-regressive (AR1) temporal prior was available.

*** Model Specification

Jeff:
- Model selection: particularly interested in  
- (1) Model specification for time trends in TMC and paediatric circumcision -> in sample fit 
- (2) Short-term future projections; ensuring appropriate future uncertainty in all countries
   -> out-of-sample prediction withholding the final survey (and any survey in the one year previous) 

- Choose best model specification (i.e. which terms to include (TMC, paediatric MMC, etc)) for
  each country using within-sample validation.
- Include figures comparing models for each country in appendix, refer to them here.
#+begin_comment
Here describe the method used for the comparison (out of sample prediction process) and
metrics used for comparison. Report the results of the model selection in the appendix.
#+end_comment
- Credible interval coverage, ELPD, CRPS and fit statistics (ME, MSE, RMSE) used to inform
  decision. 

**** Rough draft (w/out figures & conclusions) (May go to appendix)  :ignore:

In our choice of model specification, we were interested in two main assumptions/features of the
model:
- How we should treat TMC, in terms of whether to continue to assume a constant rate of TMC over time, or to reject that assumption,
- How to model paediatric MMC, which should be minimal in at least the VMMC target countries.

***** Qualitative                                         :ignore:
Qualitatively, we have made some presumptions about certain countries and their circumcision patterns.

In non-VMMC SSA countries, concentrated in Western and Central Africa (WCA), TMC has historically made up the bulk of MCs.
Therefore, most MMCs in non-VMMC countries are likely to have superseded TMCs performed as part of traditional male initiation ceremonies. This suggests that MMCs in these countries are likely to be on paediatric individuals in traditional settings, so the assumption of constant and
negligible paedaitric MMC could be a poor one. 
Because any increases in MMC will come at the expense of TMC in our "competing-risks" model, it is also plausible that the assumption that TMC rates in these countries have been relatively constant may be unrealistic.
It is therefore likely that the inclusion of a time effect for TMC and not partitioning MMC into
adult and time-invariant paediatric rates will be a more realistic reflection of circumcision
patterns in non-VMMC countries. 

# Since changes to MMC in non-VMMC programmes will not have been as a result of VMMC programmes, it is likely that circumcision patterns have undergone a generational change as a result of general development in their countries. As such, a time effect for TMC in non-VMMC countries is very important for accurately modelling and understanding their circumcision patterns, particularly in how the relative makeup of M

# (Note: would be a good idea to look into surveys for these countries to see if this checks out! I.e. for non-VMMC and VMMC surveys, it might be a good idea to compare the number of people with different circumcision types for location and provider,  to substantiate this assumption)

Conversely, in VMMC priority countries changes (i.e. increases) in circumcision patterns have largely been driven by VMMC programmes.
As such, it is more realistic to assume that paediatric MMCs are minimal, in line with UNAIDS VMMC policy.
It is more difficult to say whether the rate of TMC will be constant over time in non-VMMC
countries. Historical TMC patterns in these countries differ significantly, and so it is
difficult to come up with an assumption for all countries. It may therefore be more realistic to
also allow TMC to vary over time in VMMC countries. In countries where the rate of TMC is stable
over time, the model will simply capture this behaviour, while in countries where TMC varies over
time, the inclusion of a time effect for TMC will provide the model with the additional required
flexibility to reflect this trend. We would also prefer to not have to treat every VMMC prioirity
country separately with regards to their model specification, so including a time effect for TMC
in the models for these countries seems like a logical choice. 

***** Quantitative                                                   :ignore:
\\
We have also performed a quantitative analysis of the different model specifications available
to us. A more detailed treatment of this can be found in section x of the appendix. 

- Explain method, why within-sample comparison performed here
- Describe posterior predictive comparison between model fit and empirical survey coverage estimates
- For "For x / y SSA countries" the model with .. parameters had better model fit (quote some stats)
- "For x / y non-VMMC countries, the model with ...
- "For x / y VMMC countries, the model with ...
- Therefore, our quantitative analysis reinforces what we expected to be the best model
  specifications for VMMC and non-VMMC countries from our quantitative arguments. 



*** Model Calibration and Choice of Temporal Prior                 :noexport:

**** Notes                                                         :noexport:
- Calibrated MMC-related variance hyperparameters using grid search. Idea is to use information
  from countries with more surveys to inform variance (which was suspected to be underestimated)
  in countries with fewer surveys, analagous to using a model with partial pooling for each
  country in the Sub-Saharan region, which would be much too computationally expensive to fit. 

**** Another very rough draft  (not sure if everything here is appropriate for this section) (much of this will probably go to the appendix as well!) :ignore:

For some VMMC priority countries, we do not have access to more recent survey data. 
One particular country where this is the case is Tanzania, whose most recent survey is a 2016 PHIA survey.
In these circumstances, VMMC programme data is an available source of more recent data.
The DMPPT2 model explicitly uses this data to estimate MMC. 
+Putting aside suspected problems associated with the programme data, such as individuals availing of VMMC in districts in which they are not residents, and suspected reporting biases with countries like TZA and Zimbabwe,+ the results of DMPPT2, particularly at the national level, where travel between districts is ignored, suggest that VMMC may have scaled up at a rate not anticipated by threemc where only these older surveys are available. 
+This is consistent with the out-of-sample (OOS) evaluations of our model fit to countries like ZWE, where removing access to the most recent (2018 DHS) survey similarly+
+underestimates VMMC scale up (include plot here?).+
Hence, we feel that our model likely underestimates it's own uncertainty with regards to predicting circumcision coverage for progressively later years than our last
available surveys, particularly in the case of VMMC priority countries which started with a low circumcision coverage. What we desire is a more dramatic "fanning" out of
our prediction interval as we forecast further from the last available survey data, again, particularly for VMMC countries in which there may have been a large scale up
in circumcision coverage since the last available survey, representing an intervention via VMMC programmes which our model, fit for each country separately, is not equipped to
handle.

Due to computational constraints, we cannot model each country together as one singular area hierarchy, which, through the neighbourhood correlation structure inherent in the model,
would allow the model to borrow information from countries with a large amount of available data to inform predictions in countries with older and/or fewer surveys (i.e. some partial pooling
between countries would take place).
One alternative to using a partially-pooled model is to use the uncertainty estimates which produce the best predictions for countries with more recent data to inform our uncertainty estimates in countries with less recent survey data available. 

To quantitatively explore this hypothesis, we performed an out of survey (OOS) evaluation of the model fit to each country, removing their most recent survey data and comparing posterior predictions to the survey-estimated circumcision coverage. 
(Something about this incorporating survey design/effective sample sizes etc should probably be here)
These comparisons consisted of comparisons of mean predictions, using ELPD and CRPS scores, as well as error statistics such as the ME, RME and RMSE, and evaluations of the
"calibration" of our model with regards to it's posterior predictive uncertainty for each unique region-year-age-type (what does Matt use for this) stratum of our data. 

This involved comparing survey estimates of circumcision coverage with the 50%, 80% and 95% credible intervals (CI) coverage of our posterior predictive distribution. A "good" calibration
was regarded as one in which roughly 50% of (training) survey observations fell within the 50% CI range, 85% within the 85% CI range, and 95% within the 95% range.

Two principal components of the model largely determine how the uncertainty of our model predicitions scale up over time: 
1. *The choice of temporal prior*: threemc uses an AR 1 temporal prior. However, this is easily replaceable with, for example, a random walk (RW) prior. These temporal priors
   differ consireably in how they use previous estimates to inform future predictions, and so we appraised a number of choices for our temporal prior to determine if there
   was a preferable alternative to our default AR 1 temporal prior, with regards to the particular context of increasing year-on-year uncertainty bounds.
   The choice of temporal prior was included in this OOS analysis, rather than in our
   previous within-sample parameter chioce, as the main effect of the temporal prior is in
   determining our temporal forecast. As such, an OOS validation would prove to be more informative in determining the optimal temporal prior for the largest number of countries. 
2. *The choice of (log) variance hyperparameters*: The "unpooled" optimised time-related variance hyperparameters for each respective country varied significantly, but in general certain patterns and values for these hyperparameters could be associated with a greater "fanning" out of our uncertainty bounds for successive prediction years.

/For the AR 1 model, the effect of different time correlation parameters on our uncertainty bounds was determined to be minimal, and in the interests of parsimony, these parameters were/
/ignored in our calibration efforts with this model/ ()

Of these src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$n_surveys_orig} surveys, src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$n_surveys} contained sufficent information on circumcision, as outlined in the Methods section of this paper. 
#+begin_comment
Want to add here: 
- Amongst all surveys anaylsed, there was on average x amount of left censoring (ranging from x to x), right censoring (same), unknown circumcision status, (done)
- The final dataset contained x individual survey respondents for x birth cohorts from 1950 through 2005 (entering adulthood at age 15 between 1965 and 2020). 
- The sample size per dataset ranged from 1364 (male, Eswatini MICS 2014) to 41,821 (female, Nigeria DHS 2018).

#+end_comment
These remaining surveys consisted of src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$n_respondents} individuals respondents from src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$n_cohorts} birth cohorts from src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$min_cohort} to src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$max_cohort}. The sample size per survey ranged from src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$max_survey_size$n} in the src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$max_survey_size$survey} survey to src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$min_survey_size$n} in the src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$min_survey_size$survey} survey.

There was significant censoring and missing data even in the remaining surveys. 
Left censoring of circumcision status, analagous to unknown circumcision age, averaged  src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$mean_l_cens_perc} across all surveys, and ranged from src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$min_l_cens_perc$min} in the src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$min_l_cens_perc$survey} survey to src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$max_l_cens_perc$max} in the src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$max_l_cens_perc$survey} survey.
src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{length(data_inlines$l_cens_surveys$surveys_0.9)} surveys had more than 90% left censoring of circumcision age, with src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{length(data_inlines$l_cens_surveys$surveys_0.1)} surveys having less than 10% left censoring.
No information on age at circumcision was present in the 2004 and 2008 Botswana Aids Impact Surveys. This complete left censoring of circumcised individuals meant that threemc could not be fit to Botswana. 
Right censoring of circumcision status, indicating as of yet uncircumcised individuals, averaged src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$mean_r_cens_perc} across all surveys, ranging from src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$min_r_cens_perc$min} in the src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$min_r_cens_perc$survey} survey to src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$max_r_cens_perc$max} in the src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$max_r_cens_perc$survey} survey.

On average across all surveys, src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$mean_unknown_status_perc} of respondents did not respond to either the circumcision location or provider question, and so had unknown circumcision type. 
This was lowest in the src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$min_unknown_status_perc$survey} survey, at src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$min_unknown_status_perc$min}, and highest in the src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$max_unknown_status_perc$survey} survey, at src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$max_unknown_status_perc$max}.
src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{length(data_inlines$no_type_iso3)} countries had unknown circumcision type; src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$no_type_cntry}. 
Amongst these countries, left censoring averaged src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$mean_no_type_cntry_l_cens}. 
However, the mean survey circumcision coverage amongst these same countries was src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$mean_no_type_cntry_circ}, which may explain the relative lack of circumcision information available in their surveys.

value for left censoring equals value for circumcision coverage above for countries with no type info, is that correct??
Also, how could the ZAF survey have lower unknown circumcision type than the countries with no type?! Definitely need to double check that one!

In addition to Botswana, Guinea-Bissau, Equitorial Guinea and the Central African Republic were additional SSA countries where we did not have any surveys containing circumcision information, and so we were unable to fit threemc in these countries either.

**** TODO Write R code to include here for inline figures, etc
**** TODO Write Makefile to pull paper together

Makefile will need to:
- Run script to save plots
...
- Use pandoc (or pdflatex?) to convert org to (tex and then) pdf, having pulled everything else in


*** Formatting
**** DONE Remove table of contents
   CLOSED: [2022-10-17 Mon 11:53]
**** DONE Don't indent new paragraphs
CLOSED: [2022-10-19 Wed 15:46]
**** DONE Format abstract (see abstract todos section)
CLOSED: [2022-10-19 Wed 16:13]
***
**** DONE Break lines rather than having hyponated words on two lines
CLOSED: [2022-10-20 Thu 09:42]
**** DONE Make margins smaller (see Matt's latex code)
CLOSED: [2022-10-20 Thu 09:51]
**** DONE Insert whitespace between new paragraphs
CLOSED: [2022-10-20 Thu 09:51]
*** Title Page 
**** TODO Think of better title (Ask Jeff about this)
May be fine? But not very different to other examples
**** TODO Add full affiliated institution name to (formatted) authors
***  Abstract 
**** DONE Format abstract correctly
   CLOSED: [2022-10-17 Mon 13:54]

   Had to use pure latex to achieve this, but looks good now

**** TODO Rewrite abstract (slightly rewritten in poster script, need to rewrite arís)
***** TODO Add about comparison to survey and DMPPT2 estimates

***** TODO Add about (i) hyperpar/prior investigation and (ii) treatment of TMC and paediatric MMC
Can call this "model calibration" and specification

For (i), something like:
The model was calibrated ... pooled MMC variance covariance hyperparameters ... using forecast
for withheld survey. 

    
***** TODO Add something about different ages

**** TODO Write script to pull in variables for abstract figures
*** Background
*** Data 
**** TODO Rewrite to pull in survey info with inline code


**** TODO Insert plots
***** TODO Survey series plots
***** TODO Circumcision type plots
*** Methods
*** Results
*** Discussion
*** References

*** Plan, Questions, etc

Need to include sections on: 
- Comparison of models with different treatments of TMC and paediatric MMC
- Comparison of temporal priors and MMC variance/covariance hyperparameters
- Comparison to DMPPT2 data
- Comparison to survey data 
(not necessarily in this order!)

Will these be included in all of methods, results, discussion?
