  \begin{abstract}
    \noindent \textbf{Background} \\
    \noindent In 2016, UNAIDS developed a Fast-Track strategy that targeted 90\% coverage
    male circumcision (MC) among men aged 10-29 years by 2021 in priority countries in sub-Saharan 
    Africa (SSA) to reduce HIV incidence. There is substantial variation across subnational 
    regions within countries in both traditional male circumcision (TMC) practices and progress
    towards implementation of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). Tracking progress and
    remaining gaps towards VMMC HIV prevention targets requires detailed district-level circumcision
    coverage data.

    \noindent \textbf{Methods} \\
    \noindent We analysed self-reported data on male circumcision from x nationally representative household
    surveys conducted in x SSA countries between 2006-2020. A spatio-temporal Bayesian
    competing-risks time-to-event model was used to estimate rates of traditional and medical
    circumcision by age, location, and time. Circumcision coverage in 2020 was projected assuming
    continuation of estimated age-specific rates, with probabilistic uncertainty.

    \noindent \textbf{Results} \\
    \noindent Across x countries, from 2010 to 2020 an estimated x million men (x\% CI x-x million)
    were newly circumcised, of whom x million (x - x million) were medically circumcised, and
    x million (x - x million) traditionally circumcised. In 2020, MC coverage among men 10-29
    years ranged from x\% (x\% - x\%) in Zimbabwe (?) to x\% (x\%-x\%) in Togo. MMC coverage
    ranged from x\% (x\%-x\%) in Malawi to x\% (x\%-x\%) in Tanzania, and TMC coverage
    from x\% (x\%-x\%) in Eswatini to x\% (x\%-x\%) in Ethiopia. The largest increase in MMC
    coverage was in Lesotho from x\% to x\%. Within countries, the median difference in MC
    coverage between the districts with lowest and highest coverage was x\%, with the smallest
    variation in Eswatini (x\% to x\%) and largest in Zambia (x\% to x\%). x million men aged
    10-29 need to be circumcised to reach 90\% coverage in all countries.

    \noindent \textbf{Conclusions} \\
    \noindent VMMC programmes have made substantial, but uneven, progress towards male circumcision targets. Granular district and age-stratified data provide information for focusing further programme implementation.

** Plan                                                            :noexport:

Look at other similar circumcision papers to understand this

- Something about HIV
- Something about circumcisions
- Something about existing efforts to estimate circumcision

*** Research Questions                                         :ignore:

There were several key research questions which we hoped to answer with this analysis:
1. How has circumcision coverage varied subnationally across the SSA region?
2. How have patterns in circumcision coverage subnational vary for different ages? (Can word this better)
3. How in particular have patterns in TMC changed over time in response to VMMC programme implementation, and more generally across the SSA region
4. How have efforts to meet UNAIDS goals in VMMC target countries progressed, and if not met, how
   many circumcisions .. remain (??)
   (Can also word this better!!)
5. How do our results compare to those of the DMPPT2 model?

Word this better!

*** Data 

**** Surveys                                                         :ignore:

#+name: survey_inlines
#+begin_src R :results output :session :exports results

#+end_src

#+RESULTS: survey_inlines

Our data consisted of src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$n_surveys}  
nationally representative household surveys conducted in
src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$n_iso3} SSA countries
between src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$min_year} and src_R[:exports results :session :results raw]{data_inlines$max_year}.
These included several major survey series, namely the Demographic and Health Surveys
(DHS), AIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS) Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) surveys,
Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and, in the case of South Africa,
Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) surveys.
Any surveys including a question on MC status were included. 

These surveys provided individual-level data on self-reported circumcision status by male
respondents, and from this we estimated circumcision rates over time and by type for the years proceeding each survey. The following questions were of interest:
- The circumcision status of the male individual,
- The circumcision provider: whether the individual was circumcised by a health worker/professional, traditional practioner, other or unknown,
- The circumcision location: whether the individual was circumcised at a health facility, in the home of a health worker/professional, at home, at a ritual site, other or unknown
- The circumcision year, and
- The age at circumcision.

PHIA surveys do not include a question for circumcision location. Circumcisions performed by a medical professional and/or in a medical setting are categorised as MMC. Otherwise, circumcisions are TMC. Where no data is present on location or provider, circumcision type is treated as "Missing". Refer to section x of the appendix to see specific questions asked in each survey.

#+begin_comment
Should I include something about how (some?) PHIA surveys censor over 35 circumcisions?
#+end_comment

Respondents were located to their districts using masked cluster geocoordinates. Where these
coordinates were unavailable, as in several MICS surveys, respondents were located to their admin
level 1 area hierarchy, most often corresponding to a province. 

Participation rates for each survey can be found in section x of the appendix.

**** Populations                                      ::noexport:

- Sub-national populations from WorldPop (reference) were used to infer circumcision coverage from rate estimates.

120 household surveys conducted in 33 SSA countries 2002-2019
Self-reported circumcision:
- Status (MC vs uncircumcised), 
- Type (MMC vs TMC), 
- Year, and
- Age 
recorded
Sub-national populations from WorldPop (reference)

Major survey series (DHS, AIS, PHIA, MICS, HSRC in ZAF)
Individual-level data: self-reported circumcision status  by male respondents
Respondents located to districts using cluster geocoordinates
Located to admin 1 (province) where coordinates not available (MICS)
VMMC programme data not used

Circumcisions performed by a medical professional and/or in a medical setting are categorised as MMC
Otherwise, circumcisions are TMC
Where no data is present on location or provider, circumcision type  Missing

Individual-level household survey data provide direct estimates of circumcision rates over time and by type for years preceding survey

 Direct estimates of TMC practices, age at circumcision, VMMC impact
Include participation rates from surveys in paper!

*** Model

Bayesian spatio-temporal, competing-risks, time-to-event model
Stratified by age, location and time
Rates of TMC and medical male circumcision (MMC) estimated
Coverage in 2020 projected assuming continuation of estimated age-specific rates with probabilistic uncertainty
Important assumption: Probability of traditional male initiation ceremonies (TMICs) constant over time (needed? Might lead to a lot of questions!) 

Model stratified by:
Age
District
circumcision type (traditional / medical)

TMC & MMC rates estimated (by age, district, and time)
Spatial smoothing allows for district level estimates

Circumcision coverage since most recent HH survey: projected assuming continuation of estimated age-specific rates, with probabilistic uncertainty

Important assumption: TMC rate assumed constant over time

*** Aggregations                                                     :ignore:

# Should definitely steal some of Matt's write up for this

Samples drawn from model fit, weighted by population and aggregated, to produce estimates for less granular regions (e.g. District to Province aggregation).
Computed posterior summary statistics for coverage, circumcision incidence and probability of being circumcised. 
Done for all strata, for both discrete ages and “binned” age groups.

*Challenges*
Inconsistent MC self-reporting by same cohort in successive surveys
E.g. in 2017 survey, men 30-34 report higher % circumcised in 2012 than ‘same’ men age 25-29 in 2012 survey
Affects circumcision level, and distribution by type

‘Replacement’ of traditional circumcision by medical circumcision
Evidence of this in surveys from several countries; work in progress
Also not fully accounted for in DMPPT2 baseline coverage inputs

Surveys imply different level of scale-up than programme data
Several countries: surveys suggest fewer VMMCs conducted than programme data
